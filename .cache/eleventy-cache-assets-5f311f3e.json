It plays a vital role in the travel sector by providing essential services such as accommodation, food, and entertainment. Today's hospitality industry, however, faces several challenges that can be solved through further digital transformation.\n\nBlockchain technology enables direct sales incl. tradable rates and transferable bookings, increased loyalty, frictionless customer experience, personalized offers, and the digitalization of all kinds of hotel assets, even microservices (e.g., meeting rooms, F&B, spa facilities, etc.) and higher automated processes through smart contracts.​ Blockchain enabled secure customer wallets will also play a major role in the future for personalization, communication, and in-resort experiences of the guests.","QuoteName":"erichfalkensteiner","UseCaseText":"# Streamlined processes\n## Trading\nOn the Camino Network, there are new business models possible. Even trading between customers (C2C), such as reselling room nights on a dedicated platform built on Camino infrastructure is possible earning hotels an extra commission. In general, all kinds of trading options powered by NFT technology and smart contracts B2B(2C), B2C(2B), or even C2B are possible effortlessly. \n\n## Payment & settlement\nThe payment and settlement process is typically complex, time-consuming, and costly. These services and applications will change with the Camino Network. The payment process of each travel service along the value chain takes place in a global peer-to-peer network, is extremely fast, and results in significantly lower transaction costs. This could mean that even micro services and products could be offered online for the hospitality industry with a fraction to be paid in transaction costs. Another advantage is the security aspect, which is given by definition by a blockchain and makes trust or contractual paperwork between business parties redundant and reduces fraud significantly. \n\n## Room type mapping\nThis use case provides high personalization of room offers or different specific room types by allocating a wallet to each room in a hotel. This enables customers to review a specific room in a hotel or book this room again. For the B2B distribution, hotel information on Camino provides a single source of truth needed across the tourism industry.\n\n# Customer loyalty and new revenue streams\n## Incentives\n\nDo you want to increase the engagement between your customers, partners, and your brand?\n\nOne of the best ways to do this is by using reward systems. Especially on blockchain technologies, these systems work perfectly. Token rewards such as NFTs are a great tool to incentivize the behaviors of travelers, communities, or partners. In a hotel, a possible use case could be offering a free night after a minimum stay of some nights in this hotel.\n\n## Loyalty\nLoyal customers are the one thing that every brand wants to have. Hence the main question is how to increase customer loyalty. By using the camino network, a global loyalty platform is possible to use. Expanding customer loyalty by offering a free night or an individual discount on another night is a serious possibility.\n\n## Digital collectibles\nTravelers love collecting things from their trip, such as souvenirs and proof of travel. Therefore, a use case of digital collectibles is very interesting for additional income streams and customer loyalty. It can be adopted in variations.\n\n# Personalization and customer experience\n## Wallet rates\n\nWallets are able to receive direct offers from businesses with individual prices. Hence, it is possible to offer personalized deals for individual customers.\n\n## Token gated access\nImagine a hotel without any physical keys. With the help of NFTs, it is easily possible to secure your room key as a virtual token. With the same key, a hotel could handle the access of any customer to any area of a hotel or resort.\n\n## User-generated content\nUsers can generate content for various services or products on the blockchain and get rewarded simultaneously. Once a wallet is created for service, users can send information to this wallet and are incentivized to do so. Personalized reviews are a serious use case for travelers.\n\n## Information services\nBlockchain can receive information from one specific wallet, such as a hotel room. Travelers can send information to this wallet, and others can read this information. This would be a great and fast way to exchange information about one specific hotel room.\n\n## Gamification & travel gadgets \nFor instance, a hotel (chain) could offer customers a free visit once they have stayed, for example, 15 nights in any of their hotels or rooms. By allocating NFTs, the customer can get a complimentary stay in a fun way they are not used to. They could even distribute these NFTs through games the hotel could offer online or offline.
