                Travel is defined as the movement of people between distant geographical locations and occurs by various means of transportation, such as planes, trains, buses, and ships, to name a few. These transportation providers can thrive thanks to ecosystems such as ports, train stations, and airports. For this part of the travel industry in particular, it is essential to keep up with the fast pace and use technologies that ease the collaboration between multiple partners.

                    <p>NFT technology revolutionizes the retail ticketing experience by enhancing security and allowing for greater flexibility. It gives both travel providers and customers a more seamless and trustworthy experience. For example, lounge access can be bought separately from the booking process, independently from the legacy process. In addition, NFT tickets allow C2B or even C2C ticket trading. With NFTs, passengers can securely transfer, resell, and rename their tickets.</p>

                    <p>The payment process on Camino Network will change this as all travel services along the value chain take place in a global peer-to-peer network, which is extremely fast, and results in significantly lower transaction costs. This could mean that even micro services and products could be offered online at a fraction of today's transaction cost. The settlement between suppliers, partners, and B2B customers could be done more efficiently and automated. Records on the Camino Network will provide auditable data. Another advantage is the security aspect, which is given by definition by a blockchain and reduces fraud significantly.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Along the entire travel supply chain, the industry relies on identity verification to ensure passengers' safety and security and comply with regulatory requirements. However, the current process can be slow, inefficient, and vulnerable to fraud.</p>
                    <p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) introduces a new era of data management, providing travelers with true control over their personal information. This reduces the need for companies to store sensitive records, mitigating the risk of data leaks. Now travelers can create a single wallet containing all their data. This allows them to have accounts across various websites without multiple passwords, store essential travel information, and attach identity verification for secure travel bookings and other transactions.</p>
